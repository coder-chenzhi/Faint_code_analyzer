This is a Faint Code Analyzer made using Soot Framework.
The analyzer can run on java programs and will output all the lines and variables which are Faint in the program.
The main.java in the repo will have links to the program you are going to analyse and also it will call the analyzer to work on that particular program.
I am also including 6 different test cases which contains the faint code.
Please follow the tutorial on how to setup Soot in eclipse http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/tutorial/index.html
